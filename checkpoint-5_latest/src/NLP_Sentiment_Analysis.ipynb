Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.\"\\n9773,18.2685714285714286,\"On 09 July 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (f/k/a The Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 17th District.

It was alleged that the Sergeant Tased Subject without justification, failed to complete a Tactical Response Report (TRR), failed to notify a supervisor of a Taser discharge, and sparked his Taser as a warning to Subject. Officers A, B, C, and D are alleged to have failed to provide safety and/or intervene in the maltreatment of the Subject and failing to report misconduct by a department member.\"\\n9061,4.234,\"On April 14, 2014 at approximately 12:30 AM, Officer A and Officer were patrolling around Cermak Road and California Avenue when they observed and stopped Subject 1 for failing to stop at a red light. Upon observation of Subject 1, Officer A and Officer believed that Subject 1 was under the in?uence of alcohol. Officer A called Officer for assistance to which he and Officer arrived. The officers subsequently arrested Subject 1 for being under the in?uence of alcohol and transported him to the 10th District. One of the officers placed Subject 1 into the bullpen near the 10th District processing area. While in the bullpen, Subject 1 became angry and repeatedly hit the bullpen door and glass. The officers decided to handcuff Subject 1 to the wall where a struggle ensued between Subject 1 and the officers. Subject 1 alleges Officer A used excessive force during the struggle; COPA reviews these allegations.\"\\n2022,4.7763636363636364,\"_an from the accused officers after they saw him drinking alcohol on the property of an abandoned building. After a foot pursuit and struggle to take _into custody, Officer _performed a takedown and used closed hand and elbow strikes to gain control of _who gave inconsistent accounts of the incident in his civil complaint and deposition, alleged that he was running not from the officers, but from an unknown subject who had robbed him prior to the of?cer?s arrival. According to _he cooperated with Officer _as soon as he realized a police officer was behind him, but the officer still punched and elbowed him. A video recording of a portion of the incident and independent witnesses refute _claims and support Of?cer _account that _resisted him. Moreover, GPS data from the of?cers? police vehicle and contemporaneous OEMC transmissions provide additional credibility to the of?cers? accounts that they were pursuing _after seeing him drinking alcohol on the property of an abandoned building. In his reports and statements, Officer _described _as an assailant during the incident, but video evidence and witness accounts are not clear as to whether he was an assailant or merely a resister at the time Officer _punched and elbowed him.\"\\n'}"
