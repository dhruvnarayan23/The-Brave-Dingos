Checkpoint-2
Data Visualization with Tableau

Submitted by : Dhruv Narayan, Akshay Kumar, Keshav Bhandari

The Tableau workbook is under src folder - Viz_2.twbx

Opening the file takes the user to Tableau Dashboard 1 - It has all 3 visualizations that we have created.

The 3 sheets - Q1, Q1.1 and Q2 have the visualizations if the user wishes to look at them individually.

findings.pdf has detailed analysis/ explanations for visualizations.


Note : If interested, observe the SQL query under src folder - Data_Viz.sql which we used to create the Data Source - officer_css_awards.csv
The user does not need to run this query for generating Tableau results
